## How to know which pattern to use:

"""
# Ask yourself:

** Two pointers **
- do i need to look at both ends
- is the array sorted? (often a hint)
- am i comparing or swapping elements

** Sliding Window **
- am i looking for a substring or subarrray
- do i need to track somethin in range
- does the problem say 'contiguous' or ' consecutive'
